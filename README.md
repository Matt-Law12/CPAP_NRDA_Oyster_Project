## Introduction
The Florida Oyster Cultch Placement Project is a Natural Resource Damage Assessment (NRDA) Phase III Deepwater Horizon early restoration project. This project seeks to foster oyster reef habitat development, which would help compensate the public for spill-related injuries and losses to oyster habitat and benthic secondary productivity.

## Project Overview
The objective of the Florida Oyster Cultch Placement Project is to promote reef development for oysters by restoring existing, degraded oyster reef habitats that have reached their productive lifespan. The restoration work for this project included the placement of suitable cultch material on existing or previously constructed oyster bars by barge for the settling of native oyster larvae and oyster colonization. Approximately 61,943 cubic yards of oyster cultch was placed over an estimated 296 acres of existing oyster bars in the Apalachicola, St. Andrews, and Pensacola Bay Systems, including: <br />
<br />
•	Placing approximately 24,840 cubic yards of shell on 16 debilitated oyster reefs over an approximately 124-acre area in the Apalachicola Bay System in Franklin County,<br />
•	Placing approximately 17,000 cubic yards of crushed granite over an estimated 84 acres of debilitated oyster reefs in the St. Andrews Bay System in Bay County, and <br />
•	Placing approximately 20,103 cubic yards of a lime rock aggregate over an estimated 88 acres of debilitated oyster reefs in the Pensacola Bay System in Escambia and Santa Rosa Counties<br />

Cultch material consisted of combinations of oyster shells, either mined from existing sources or from active oyster shell collection sources, and/or limestone approved for use in these projects by Florida’s Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS). Placing substrate or "cultch" in bays where natural reproduction occurs is the most effective technique used throughout the Gulf of Mexico to create three-dimensional reef structure, stimulate spat setting, sustain oyster fisheries, enhance community functions, increase natural productivity, and accelerate the recovery process. Florida has been involved in rehabilitating oyster reefs for more than sixty years and provides a multi-dimensional approach built on decades of experience. These restoration methods are established methods for this type of restoration project.

## Data Collection and Analysis
To collect the monitoring data for this project, a diver descends and places a 0.25 m² quadrat on the bottom in a haphazard manner near the transect line. Live oysters, shell, and associated fauna are removed to the depth of the sediment, placed in mesh collecting bags, and delivered to the survey vessel. This is repeated five times on each side of the boat, as well as off the bow of the boat. A total of 15 quadrats (5 starboard, 5 port, and 5 bow) are sampled for each midpoint. 

Samples are processed once all the quadrats have been collected for a midpoint. First, the sample is weighed using a digital hanging scale. If oysters are present in the collected sample, shell height of the first 100 live oysters is measured to the nearest millimeter (mm). Oyster shell height is defined as the distance from the umbo to the distal margin of the shell. If the sample contains more than 100 live oysters, the remaining live oysters are counted. Live oysters are divided into one of three size classes: spat (0-25 mm), seed (26-74 mm), and harvestable adult (75 mm and larger). The number of dead oysters in the sample is also counted.

Oyster populations are described in each bay by plotting parameters such as: total number of live vs. dead oysters, total number of oysters by size class, density of live oysters, average oyster size, etc. 

To determine the relative condition of oyster resources, an estimate of harvestable oysters is determined using FDACS’ Standard Oyster Resource Management Protocol (see Appendix 1). This protocol has been used in Apalachicola Bay since 1982. FDACS uses a scale that states that 400 bags/acre could be harvested from productive artificially constructed reefs within two years of planting cultch. The scale is as follows: 

•	More than 400 bags/acre = Healthy oyster reefs capable of sustaining commercial harvest.
•	More than 200 bags/acre = Oyster reefs capable of sustaining limited harvest.
•	Less than 200 bags/acre = Below level necessary to support commercial harvest.
•	Less than 100 bags/acre = Oyster reefs considered depleted.

The collected monitoring data was then entered and analyzed by CPAP staff to determine the success of the restoration work. Monitoring reports are then created and released on an annual basis to

Along with the annual monitoring reports that are published by CPAP, an [interactive PowerBI dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiODhhZGQxZmYtYjYzYy00MTQ0LWI3M2EtZmE3NzdlODdlOGE3IiwidCI6ImI2MjAxOTYwLTQ1YmEtNGI3OC1iMDgwLWYxYzQzM2ZmNmUzNiIsImMiOjZ9) was created which enables users to explore key insights through dynamic visuals, making the complex monitoring data more accessible and engaging— far beyond what static graphs or traditional reports can offer.

## Results

### Apalachicola Bay
Over the course of sampling, a total of 22,111 live oysters and 5,888 dead oysters have been collected in Apalachicola Bay. The total number of live oysters collected in Round 5 (n=643) decreased from Round 1 (n=7479) as well as from Round 4 (n=3212). A decrease in dead oysters sampled was also observed from Round 1 (n=3451) to Round 5 (n=180) and Round 4 (n=435) to Round 5. Round 5 represents the least number of live oysters collected during sampling across all rounds thus far. 

A comparison of size classes among live oysters showed that spat-sized oysters continued to be the most prevalent in all sampling rounds, representing approximately 79.89% of total live oysters processed to date and roughly 52.57% of total live oysters processed during Round 5 of sampling (n=338). Seed sized oysters and adult sized oysters represented 30.64% and 16.80% of oysters sampled in Round 5, respectively. Adult-sized, harvestable oysters continued to represent the least abundant size class, as is expected. While a statistically significant decrease in live oysters sampled was observed in the seed and spat size classes from Round 4 to Round 5, alternatively, a significant increase was observed in the number of adults sampled. The decrease in number of adults sampled from Round 1 to Round 5 was not significant. It should be noted that, with the significant decreases in number of seed and spat in Round 5, and in turn the decrease in number of total oysters in Round 5, a departure from typical population distribution of size classes was observed in Round 5, resulting in a more even distribution of total oysters per size class than in previous rounds.

Anecdotally, local oystermen have stated that oyster populations on the west side of Apalachicola Bay have been declining more rapidly than those on the east side, particularly in the area referred to as “The Miles”. To account for potential regional differences, sites have been separated by geographic location in Apalachicola Bay. Sites located to the east of the Apalachicola River (Cat Point, Hotel Bar, Lighthouse Bar, Norman’s Bar Middle, and Norman’s Bar North) are considered “East” sites, and those located to the west of the river (Bayou Flats, Cabbage Lumps, Cabbage Top, Dry Bar, Eleven Mile North, Eleven Mile South, Green Point, Little Gully, North Spur, Redfish Creek 1, and Redfish Creek 2) are considered “West”. For all rounds of sampling, the East side of the bay contained more live oysters across all size classes than the West side. The number of live oysters sampled on both the East and West sides decreased from Round 1 to Round 5. Decreases in spat and seed sized oysters were observed on both sides of the bay from Round 4 to Round 5. An increase in adult sized oysters was observed on the East side from Round 4 (n=22) to Round 5 (n=92), and the number of adults on the West side remained consistent from Round 4 to Round 5 (n=16).

Average shell height of oysters sampled from Apalachicola Bay In Round 5 was 39.23 mm, nearly double the average shell height of all oysters measured in Round 4 (n=15.77mm). Average shell heights from all previous rounds were representative of the spat size class (0-25mm), which is to be expected with their relative abundance. In Round 5, a larger number of adult oysters present in samples, paired with significant decreases in spat and seed sized oysters, shifted the average shell height into the seed size class (26-74mm).

The estimated density of live oysters varied greatly by site and across rounds. In Round 5, the highest estimated density of live oysters occurred at Lighthouse Bar (n=27.27 oysters/m2). A decline in estimated oyster density was observed at all sites from Round 4 to Round 5. The greatest decline was observed at Norman’s Bar Middle, which decreased from 70.27 oysters/m² to 0.40 oysters/m² from Round 4 to Round 5. Most sites also saw decreases from Round 1 to Round 5, with only Green Point increasing in live oyster density from Round 1 to Round 5 (n=0.80 oysters/m² to 6.93 oysters/m², respectively). 

FDACS protocols were used to estimate the number of bags of harvestable oysters per site. None of the sites sampled in Apalachicola Bay in Round 5 are capable of sustaining commercial harvest, and all sites but Lighthouse Bar (n=146.29 bags/acre) are considered depleted. Five of the 16 sites saw an increase in estimated bags per acre of harvestable oysters from Round 4 to Round 5 (Cat Point, Green Point, Lighthouse Bar, Norman’s Bar North, and Redfish Creek 2).  Of these, Green Point, Lighthouse Bar, and Norman’s Bar North also represent increases in bags/acre from Round 1 to Round 5. All other sites either remain unchanged or represent decreases in bags/acre from Round 1 to Round 5 and Round 4 to Round 5. It should be noted that Dry Bar, Hotel Bar, Little Gully, and North Spur have not had adult harvestable oysters present, and therefore no amount of bags/acre, thus far. 

When analyzed by side of bay, it is evident that neither the East nor West side are capable of producing enough adult oysters to sustain commercial harvest. The number of bags per acre of harvestable oysters has decreased since Round 1 on both sides of the bay, though only slightly on the East side. From Round 4 to Round 5, a considerable increase in number of bags per acre occurred (9.59 bags/acre to 40.12 bags/acre). The number of bags per acre on the West side decreased from Round 1 (n=14.95 bags/acre) to Round 5 (n=4.51 bags/acre) but remained unchanged from Round 4 to Round 5. The trend of higher productivity on the East side of Apalachicola Bay is again represented by the higher number of bags per acre calculated on the East side vs. the West side in each sampling round.

Determining the spatial extent of oyster reefs includes defining individual areal reef footprints (the entire area of the reef complex) in addition to defining reef area (the actual area of patches of living and nonliving substrate with or without live oysters) within reef footprints. Bottom composition data was collected at each cultched reef site utilizing side-scan sonar via a vessel-mounted Humminbird GPS unit. ReefMaster 2.0, a spatial analysis software, and ArcGIS Pro were used to process the collected imagery data and determine the spatial extent of each cultched reef. Bottom composition map projects displaying reef hardness were generated in ReefMaster 2.0. Regions displaying the greatest hardness values were considered reef substrate and calculated in ArcGIS Pro to determine reef area values. Calculated reef areas in Apalachicola Bay can be seen below in Table 5. Discrepancies in reported reef areas exist in the original FDACS report, as well as between the original reported acreages and the acreages calculated in ArcGIS Pro utilizing the GPS coordinates provided by FDACS for each cultched area. All reef area values were calculated utilizing the acreages as determined in ArcGIS Pro. This first instance of reef mapping in Apalachicola Bay (referred to below as ‘Time 1’) took place during spring/summer of 2022, approximately 6.5 years after initial deposition of cultch at the various sites. Mapping of the reefs was not completed at the Year 2 assessment due to previously mentioned unanticipated circumstances. This mapping effort approximately coincides with Round 4 material sampling efforts provided in this report. Patches of substrate with or without oysters represent 65.25% (83.53 acres) of the approximately 128 acres, as determined in ArcGIS.

### St Andrews Bay
To date, 57,966 live oysters and 7,424 dead oysters have been sampled from St. Andrews Bay.  In Round 5, 17,823 live oysters and 1,021 dead oysters were sampled. The increases in number of live oysters from both Round 1 to Round 5 and Round 4 to Round 5, analyzed on a per sample basis, were statistically significant (p=8.10x10-12 and p=3.30x10-19, respectively). The decrease in number of dead oysters from Round 1 to Round 5 was also statistically significant (p=2.80x10-8). The number of dead oysters sampled in Round 5 did not differ significantly from the previous round. 

A comparison of oyster abundance by size-class of Round 5 data shows that spat sized oysters continued to be the most abundant (n=15972), followed by seed sized oysters (n=1777) and adult sized, harvestable oysters (n=72). Increases were observed across all size classes from Round 1 to Round 5 and from Round 4 to Round 5. When analyzed on a per sample basis, these increases in live oysters in all size classes across multiple rounds were statistically significant; however, the increase in adult sized oysters from Round 1 to Round 5 was not significant (p < 0.05) (Figure 23).

In all previous rounds of sampling, West Bay has produced the highest total number of live oysters. However, East Bay was the most productive in Round 5 (n=8437 live oysters), with the highest number of live oysters observed across all three size classes. East Bay was the only region of the St. Andrews Bay system that had adult oysters present in Round 4 samples, and in Round 5, East Bay samples contained 94.59% of all adults collected (n=70). North Bay continues to be the least productive of all the bays with the least number of oysters across all size classes observed in each round. This is unsurprising, as the North Bay region is comprised of only two sites with single sampling midpoints (Norman Bayou Bar and East of Power Lines Ridge). All regions of the bay saw an increase in each size class from Round 4 to Round 5, with the exception of adults in North Bay (n=0 for both rounds) (Figure 24).

When comparing size class distribution by site, increases in the number of spat sized and seed sized oysters were observed from Round 4 to Round 5 at all sites. Increases in adult sized oysters were observed at all sites except for East of Power Lines Ridge, Newman Bayou Bar, South Channel Ridge, and West Bay Point, at which no changes occurred (n=0 for both rounds). The number of live oysters observed at Off Little Oyster Bar Point represented the greatest increase in live oysters from Round 4 (n=253) to Round 5 (n=4429), accounting for 24.85% of the total oysters sampled during Round 5. Spat were observed at all sites sampled during Round 5, with the highest number of spat observed at Off Little Oyster Bar Point (n=3955) (Figure 25).

The average shell height of all oysters sampled in St. Andrews Bay during Round 5 was 17.81 mm (Figure 28). Statistical analysis showed that the average shell height observed in Round 5 was significantly less than that of Round 1 (n=19.37mm, p=5.30x10-9), as well as significantly less than the average shell height in Round 4 (n=18.75, p=4.30x10-5).

The estimated density of live oysters increased from Round 4 to Round 5 in all three bays. Anomalously low densities were observed in Round 4 when compared to the trends of preceding rounds, suggesting that the increases in live oyster density in Round 5 may represent a return toward more ideal conditions for oyster settlement and growth. Live oyster densities in East and North Bays represented the highest live oyster estimates to date (n=749.96 and n=362.67 live oysters/m2, respectively) (Figure 34).

It is evident that all reefs have estimates below levels capable of sustaining commercial harvest. East and West Bays saw increases in estimated bags per acre from Round 4 to Round 5, and North Bay remained at 0 bags per acre. East Bay had the highest estimate of bags per acre in Round 5 (n=111.92 bags/acre); however, this is still below the level necessary to support commercial harvest. North (n=0 bags/acre) and West Bay (n=3.20 bags/acre) as collective regions are considered depleted resources (Figure 36).

Determining the spatial extent of oyster reefs includes defining individual areal reef footprints (the entire area of the reef complex) in addition to defining reef area (the actual area of patches of living and nonliving substrate with or without live oysters) within reef footprints (Baggett et al. 2014). Bottom composition data was collected at each cultched reef site utilizing side-scan sonar via a vessel-mounted Humminbird GPS unit. ReefMaster 2.0, a spatial analysis software, and ArcGIS Pro were used to process the collected imagery data and determine the spatial extent of each cultched reef. Bottom composition map projects displaying reef hardness were generated in ReefMaster 2.0. Regions displaying the greatest hardness values were considered reef substrate and calculated in ArcGIS Pro to determine reef area values. Calculated reef areas in St. Andrews Bay can be seen below in Table 9. Discrepancies in reef areas exist between the original FDACS report and acreages calculated in ArcGIS Pro utilizing the GPS coordinates provided by FDACS for each cultched area. All reef area values were calculated utilizing the acreages as determined in ArcGIS Pro. This first instance of reef mapping in Pensacola Bay (referred to below as ‘Time 1’) took place during fall of 2022, roughly 6 years after initial deposition of cultch at the various sites. Mapping of the reefs was not completed at the Year 2 assessment due to previously mentioned unanticipated circumstances. This mapping effort approximately coincides with Round 4 material sampling efforts provided in this report. Patches of substrate with or without oysters represent 58.22% (42.81 acres) of the approximately 73.53 acres, as determined in ArcGIS.

### Pensacola Bay

To date, 24,144 live and 3,555 dead oysters have been sampled from Pensacola Bay.  In Round 5, 5,823 live oysters and 437 dead oysters were collected.  While the number of live oysters sampled from Round 1 to Round 5 were not statistically significant when analyzed on a per sample basis, the increase of live oysters per sample from Round 4 to Round 5 was significant (p=3.70x10-27). In regards to dead oysters sampled, the decrease observed from Round 1 to Round 5 and the increase from Round 4 to Round 5 were also statistically significant when analyzed on a per sample basis (p=3.10x10-12 and p=3.20x10-14, respectively) (Figure 40).

Spat sized oysters were the most abundant size class in Round 5 (n=3499), followed by seed sized (n=2321) and adult sized harvestable oysters (n=3). The relative abundance per size class in Round 5 showed a departure from the size class trends observed in Round 4 but aligned with population trends observed in all other previous rounds. Changes in the number of live oysters per size class observed from Round 1 to Round 5 were insignificant. However, the increases in spat and seed per sample from Round 4 to Round 5 were significant (p=1.20x10-29 and p=4.90x10-18, respectively).  The decrease in adults per sample from Round 4 to Round 5 was also statistically significant (p=0.004) (Figure 41).    

Abundance of oysters varied by geographic region, with more live oysters being collected in East Bay than in Escambia Bay in all five rounds (Figure 42). In Round 5, 4,785 live oysters (82.17% of oysters collected) were sampled in East Bay, while 1038 live oysters (17.83%) were collected from Escambia Bay. This disparity is expected, as most sample sites (15 of 19 midpoints) are located in East Bay. The East Bay sites have traditionally been more productive than the Escambia Bay sites; this still held true in Round 5.  Increases in spat and seed size classes were observed from Round 4 to Round 5 on both sides of the bay, most notably in East Bay. However, the number of adult oysters collected from either side of the bay was less than in the previous round, and considerably so in East Bay from Round 4 (n=14) to Round 5 (n=2). The dominant size class in Round 5 was spat on both sides of the bay, showing a shift in size class data collected during Round 4 but returning to a more traditional relative abundance of oysters per size class to other previous rounds. 

The greatest number of spat observed in Round 5 was at Escribano Point #2 (n=892). This site also had the largest number of live oysters documented overall in Round 5 (n=1406). Zero spat were observed in Round 5 at Boathouse Lumps #2, and only one was documented at Trout Bayou #1 (Figure 43).

The greatest number of seed sized oysters was observed at Escribano Point #1 in Round 5 (n=560), followed by Escribano Point #2 (n=514). Zero seed sized oysters were observed at Boathouse Lumps #2, East River #2, East River #3, Half Moon Bar, Mussel Beds, Point No Point Bar, and Square Bar Round 5. These sites also did not have seed present in samples in Round 4. (Figure 44)

Only East River #1 (n=2) and Trout Bayou #2 (n=1) had adult sized, harvestable oysters present in Round 5.  These sites were also two of the five to have adults present in samples from Round 4.  No adult oysters have been sampled to date at the following sites: Boathouse Lumps #2, Half Moon Bar, Point No Point Bar, Trout Bayou #1, and White Point Bar #1 (Figure 45). Harvestable, adult oysters have remained relatively low throughout all rounds of sampling.

Average shell height in Pensacola Bay was 22.59 mm in Round 5, which differs significantly from that of Round 1 (n=24.27mm) and Round 4 (n=40.07mm) (p=4.00x10-23 and p=1.10x10-23, respectively).  The significant decrease in average shell height from Round 4 to Round 5 can be attributed to the shift in relative size class abundance observed, with a significant increase in spat and seed sized oysters and decrease in number of adults observed in Round 5.  

Estimated density provides a clearer understanding of the general distribution of the oyster population present within a standardized area and accounts for differences in sampling efforts (i.e. larger number of samples per site due to different midpoints per site). Estimated live oyster density in Round 5 (n=81.73 live oysters/m2) increased substantially from Round 4 (n=2.81 live oysters/m2), evident by the significant increase in live oysters observed in this round. The density of live oysters in Round 5 is much more consistent with rounds prior to the exceptionally low density observed in Round 4 and suggests a rebound in the population following a period of less suitable conditions for oyster settlement and/or survival in Pensacola Bay (Figure 50).

The highest estimated density of live oysters in Round 5 was at Escribano Point #2 (n=374.93 live oysters/m2), which also had the highest density in Round 4. Boathouse Lumps #2 had no live oysters present in Round 5 samples and therefore had an estimated live oyster density of zero oysters/m2. All sites in Round 5 had live oysters present with higher estimated oyster density than Round 4, except for Boathouse Lumps #2, although the decrease at this site was negligible. Escribano Point #1 had the second highest estimated density in Round 5 (n=274.13 oysters/m2) and both Escribano sites experienced a substantial increase in live oyster density from previous rounds. Escribano Point #1’s proximity to Escribano Point #2, a site that has remained relatively productive since Round 2, suggests that this region of East Bay may be more suitable than others for larval oyster settlement or may represent spillover effects of Escribano Point #2’s productivity onto nearby reefs. Higher live oyster density at Escribano Point #1 subsequently reflected that of Escribano Point #2 beginning in Round 3. Notable increases in live oyster density at Escribano Point #1 & #2 and White Point #1 &#2 since Round 1 suggest that conditions at these sites have been suitable for oyster settlement and growth since cultching occurred (Figure 52).

Bags per acre of harvestable oysters is the standard utilized by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) to evaluate overall productivity for a shellfish harvesting area and determine whether a particular area is suitable for commercial harvest (see Attachment 1).  A minimum of 200 bags/acre of harvestable oysters is required to sustain limited commercial harvest, and below 100 bags/acre is considered a depleted resource. Estimated bags per acre for the entire Pensacola Bay system remained low in Round 5 (n=0.76 bags/acre), which has remained low across all rounds.  No sites sampled in Round 5 had estimates considered capable of sustaining commercial harvest, which is also consistent with findings of previous rounds. Decreases in bags per acre were observed from Round 4 to Round 5 at East River #1 (n=4.90 bags/acre) Escribano Point #1 (n=0 bags/acre), Escribano Point #2 (n=0 bags/acre), No Name Bar (n=0), and Trout Bayou #2 (n=2.40 bags/acre). All sites sampled to date have been below the threshold for a ‘depleted resource’ (<100 bags/acre), and only East River #1 has shown an increase in bags per acre of harvestable oysters from Round 1 (n=0 bags/acre) to Round 5 (n=4.80 bags/acre). (Table 12) 

Decreases in estimated bags per acre of harvestable oysters were seen in both East Bay and in Escambia Bay from Round 4 to Round 5. Escambia Bay (n=0.96 bags/acre) had a slightly higher estimated number of bags per acre than East Bay (n=0.69 bags/acre) in Round 4, although both represent depleted resources incapable of sustaining commercial harvest as collective regions (Figure 53). 

Determining the spatial extent of oyster reefs includes defining individual areal reef footprints (the entire area of the reef complex) in addition to defining reef area (the actual area of patches of living and nonliving substrate with or without live oysters) within reef footprints (Baggett et al. 2014). Bottom composition data was collected at each cultched reef site utilizing side-scan sonar via a vessel-mounted Humminbird GPS unit. ReefMaster 2.0, a spatial analysis software, and ArcGIS Pro were used to process the collected imagery data and determine the spatial extent of each cultched reef. Bottom composition map projects displaying reef hardness were generated in ReefMaster 2.0.  Regions displaying the greatest hardness values were considered reef substrate and calculated in ArcGIS Pro to determine reef area values. Calculated reef areas in Pensacola Bay can be seen below in Table 13. Discrepancies in reported reef areas exist in the original FDACS report, as well as between the original reported acreages and the acreages calculated in ArcGIS Pro utilizing the GPS coordinates provided by FDACS for each cultched area. All reef area values were calculated utilizing the acreages as determined in ArcGIS Pro. This first instance of reef mapping in Pensacola Bay (referred to below as ‘Time 1’) took place during summer/fall of 2022, roughly 6 years after initial deposition of cultch at the various sites. This mapping effort approximately coincides with Round 4 material sampling efforts provided in this report. Patches of substrate with or without oysters represent 73.45% (51.62 acres) of the approximately 70.29 acres, as determined in ArcGIS.
