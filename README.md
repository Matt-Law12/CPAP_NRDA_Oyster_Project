## Project Overview
The Florida Oyster Cultch Placement Project is a Natural Resource Damage Assessment (NRDA) Phase III Deepwater Horizon early restoration project. As a result of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and associated response activities, oyster reefs located along Florida’s Panhandle suffered adverse impacts. This project seeks to foster oyster reef habitat development, which would help compensate the public for Spill-related injuries and losses to oyster habitat and benthic secondary productivity.

Healthy oyster reefs play a vital role in the environment — they provide habitat for marine life, improve water quality, and support local fishing communities. This project aims to bring those benefits back by rebuilding degraded oyster habitats in targeted areas along Florida’s Gulf Coast.

## Restoration Work

To restore these vital reefs, we placed more than 61,000 cubic yards of reef-building material, known as cultch, across nearly 300 acres of existing oyster bars in three bay systems:

•	Apalachicola Bay (Franklin County): ~24,840 cubic yards of oyster shell placed over 124 acres <br />
•	St. Andrews Bay (Bay County): ~17,000 cubic yards of crushed granite over 84 acres <br />
•	Pensacola Bay (Escambia & Santa Rosa Counties): ~20,100 cubic yards of limestone over 88 acres <br />

This material gives oyster larvae (called spat) a place to settle and grow, helping to rebuild reefs naturally.

## Why It Matters
Oyster reefs are vital to the health, economy, and culture of the Florida Panhandle. By restoring these reefs, the project:

• Supports the recovery of oyster populations <br />
• Improves water quality through natural filtration <br />
• Rebuilds habitat for fish and other marine life <br />
• Enhances commercial and recreational fishing opportunities <br />

Florida has been involved in rehabilitating oyster reefs for more than sixty years and provides a multi-dimensional approach built on decades of experience. The restoration techniques used in this project are well-established and widely recognized as effective for rebuilding oyster reef habitat.

## Monitoring
To see how the reefs have responded to our restoration efforts, we monitor oyster abundance, growth, and survival on a yearly basis. Our observations allow use to determine if the reefs have reached population levels capable of sustaining commercial harvest. These results help guide future restoration efforts and ensure long-term success.

To determine the relative condition of oyster resources, an estimate of harvestable oysters is determined using FDACS’ Standard Oyster Resource Management Protocol, which has been utilized in Apalachicola Bay since 1982. FDACS uses a scale that states that 400 bags/acre could be harvested from productive artificially constructed reefs within two years of planting cultch. The scale is as follows: 

•	More than 400 bags/acre = Healthy oyster reefs capable of sustaining commercial harvest. <br />
•	More than 200 bags/acre = Oyster reefs capable of sustaining limited harvest. <br />
•	Less than 200 bags/acre = Below level necessary to support commercial harvest. <br />
•	Less than 100 bags/acre = Oyster reefs considered depleted. <br />

The collected monitoring data is analyzed by CPAP staff to determine the success of the restoration work and compiled into annual monitoring reports.

Along with the annual monitoring reports that are published by CPAP, an [interactive PowerBI dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiODhhZGQxZmYtYjYzYy00MTQ0LWI3M2EtZmE3NzdlODdlOGE3IiwidCI6ImI2MjAxOTYwLTQ1YmEtNGI3OC1iMDgwLWYxYzQzM2ZmNmUzNiIsImMiOjZ9) was created which enables users to explore our monitoring data through dynamic visuals, making the complex data more accessible and engaging— far beyond what static graphs or traditional reports can offer.

## Results

### Apalachicola Bay
In Apalachicola Bay, over 22,000 live oysters and nearly 6,000 dead oysters have been sampled so far. However, the number of live oysters has declined steadily from the first round of sampling to the most recent (Round 5), with the lowest count recorded in Round 5.

The majority of oysters collected across all rounds were spat-sized (0-25 mm), which made up nearly 80% of all live oysters sampled. In Round 5, spat made up about half of the total, with seed-sized oysters (26-74 mm) and adult harvestable oysters (75 mm and larger) making up the rest. While the total number of live oysters in Round 5 of monitoring decreased from Round 4, there was a slight increase in the number of adult oysters observed. 

When analyzing the bay based on geographical parameters:

• The East side (sites located east of the Apalachicola River) consistently had more oysters than the West side, across all size classes. <br />
• Oystermen have observed more noticeable declines on the West side, especially in an area known as “The Miles.” <br />
• Lighthouse Bar, on the East side, had the highest oyster density in Round 5. <br />

Still, overall productivity has dropped. Based on the FDAC's Standard Oyster Resource Management Protocol, none of the sites in Apalachicola Bay are currently productive enough to support commercial harvest. Only Lighthouse Bar came close, with an estimate of about 146 harvestable oyster bags per acre — still below the 200 bags/acre necessary to supportcommercial harvest.

Advanced mapping technology was used to determine the actual area of reef coverage. This effort showed that about 65% of the reef footprint still contains hard substrate necessary for spat settlement, representing  just over 83 acres of the original 128-acre restoration area.

### St. Andrews Bay
In the St. Andrews Bay system, nearly 58,000 live oysters have been sampled, and numbers have increased significantly since the start of the project. The latest round (Round 5) saw the highest numbers yet — with a clear rise across all oyster size classes.

Key highlights:

• East Bay, part of the St. Andrews system, had the most live oysters in Round 5 — and was the only region to contain adult oysters in both Rounds 4 and 5. <br />
• North Bay remained the least productive region, largely due to fewer sampling sites and historically lower oyster populations. <br />

The average oyster size in Round 5 was slightly smaller than in earlier rounds, likely due to the higher number of spat. Still, this increase in young oysters is a good sign that conditions are favorable for future growth.

Estimated oyster density per square meter also jumped significantly, especially in East and North Bays. However, despite the growth, none of the areas have yet reached harvestable levels, with even the most productive sites falling short of the commercial threshold.

Mapping revealed that about 58% of the reef areas (nearly 43 acres of 74 originally restored) still provide suitable hard substrate for oyster growth.

### Pensacola Bay
Pensacola Bay has seen modest but important improvements. So far, more than 24,000 live oysters have been sampled. The latest round of sampling showed a significant increase in live oyster numbers compared to the previous round, especially in the East Bay, which consistently outperforms Escambia Bay.

In Round 5:

• Spat and seed oysters made up nearly all the oysters collected. <br />
• Only three adult oysters were found across the entire bay system, a sharp drop from previous rounds. <br />

Escribano Point was the standout site, producing the highest number of oysters overall and the highest oyster density (375 oysters/m²). In contrast, some sites like Boathouse Lumps had no live oysters at all.

Average oyster size also dropped in Round 5, reflecting the lower number of adult oysters and the higher number of spat.

While oyster densities have rebounded from low points in earlier rounds, the number of harvestable oysters remains far too low. The highest estimated productivity was just under 5 bags/acre — far below the 200 bags/acre needed for even limited commercial harvest.

Mapping data showed that about 73% of the restored area (52 out of 70 acres) still contains suitable hard reef substrate, suggesting that the physical structure for future reef growth is still in place
